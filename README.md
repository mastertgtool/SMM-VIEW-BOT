## Hosting on a VPS (24/7)

### Prerequisites

- **VPS Server**: Obtain a VPS server from a provider like AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, or any other VPS hosting service. Ensure it runs a Linux distribution (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.).
- **SSH Access**: Ensure you have SSH access to your VPS. You'll need the server's IP address, username, and private key for SSH authentication.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Connect to VPS via SSH**:

   ```bash
   ssh username@your_server_ip
   ```

2. **Update System Packages**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-pip -y
   ```

4. **Upload Your Bot Files**:

   - **Using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)**:
   
     Use SCP to transfer your bot files (including `bot.py` and `requirements.txt`) to the VPS. Replace `/path/to/your/private_key`, `/path/to/your/local/bot/files/`, `username@your_server_ip`, and `/path/to/remote/bot/directory/` with appropriate values.
   
     ```bash
     scp -i /path/to/your/private_key /path/to/your/local/bot/files/* username@your_server_ip:/path/to/remote/bot/directory/
     ```

   - **Using SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)**:

     Alternatively, you can use SFTP to transfer files securely to your VPS. Connect to your server and use `put` command to upload files.

     ```bash
     sftp -i /path/to/your/private_key username@your_server_ip
     sftp> put /path/to/your/local/bot/files/* /path/to/remote/bot/directory/
     ```

   - **Using Git (Clone Repository)**:

     If your bot's code is hosted in a Git repository, you can clone it directly onto your VPS.

     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url> /path/to/remote/bot/directory/
     ```

5. **Install Python Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/remote/bot/directory/
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Run the Bot in the Background**:

   ```bash
   nohup python3 bot.py &
   ```

7. **Close SSH Connection**:

   You can now close the SSH connection, and your bot will continue running on the VPS.

Your bot is now hosted on a VPS and will run continuously in the background. Please ensure your code handles exceptions and errors gracefully for smooth, long-term operation.
